# Gfx Demo

So... after starting out writing a Wayland client with just libwayland in [C](https://github.com/Liam-Malone/wayland_gfx) and in [Zig](https://github.com/Liam-Malone/zig-wayland_gfx), I got curious and decided I'd like to try invoking calls through the wayland socket directly. With no libwayland. I found [this guide](https://gaultier.github.io/blog/wayland_from_scratch.html) on writing a Wayland GUI client from scratch in C, and decided to try following along in Zig.

Once I am satisfied with my aims for this project, I may return to those previous client projects, or I may simply continue to expand this project
